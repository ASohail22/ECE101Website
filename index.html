        <h1>Course Description </h1>
        
        <p class="courseDescriptionText">
           Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) is the field of engineering that has a broad reach, many real-world 
           applications and a great impact on our lives, yet few know the impact of ECE in solving humanity’s problems. 
           This course will introduce students to the field of ECE and provide a broad overview of its subfields and its 
           applications through a series of hands-on project experiences based on current design trends. 
           This course will also stimulate students’ interests in this field by demonstrating the extensive reach of ECE in 
           solving a very wide range of current and emerging problems that most people do not even realize that are solved by 
           advancements in ECE. Finally, this course will also provide a preview of the ECE program of study, introducing some of 
           the most critical concepts taught throughout the curriculum, including instrumentation, microprocessor programming, 
           embedded systems, circuit analysis, signal processing, and machine learning. This course will be taught from a hands-on 
           and project based approach, focused on integrating many of the topics covered in the course.

           ECE 101 - Solving Tomorrow's Problems is an introductory course for Electrical & Computer Engineering Students introducing them to the various fields within ECE. Emerging topics within the field are also discussed, while provideing a hands on learning experience through project-based work. Students will be introduced to programming 
           concepts and utillizing lab equipment that will remain with them for the duration of their career. Since this class is relatively new, it is important to find ways to improve on it, 
           making the transition into the program for new students easier. New students may feel lost or even unaware of what the program will entail. 
           This site is designed to provide several resources to ensure the sucess of new students.
